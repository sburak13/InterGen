Tagline: Inspiring students and senior citizens to foster intergenerational relationships

Description: 

InterGen is an online video conferencing platform that was created in order to connect the youth to seniors. According to UCSF, more than 40 percent of seniors regularly experience loneliness. Researchers have found that the feeling of separation and disconnection from others may predict serious health problems and even death. An intergenerational relationship is advantageous for both seniors and students. Through these conversations, both groups will be able to find a new sense of purpose and learn new skills. In addition, this video calling system may help alleviate fears that students have of the elderly. Senior Citizens are more likely to be energized and this may also reduce the likelihood of depression. 

This platform contains a Sign In Page for both students and seniors to log in. Both students and seniors will be able to chat with each other using the video call button,  and also see their previous call history. There is a timer as well so that students can track their volunteer progress and send it to counselors for approval.
