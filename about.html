      <h2> What is InterGen?
        
      </h2>
      <p>
        
        Intergen is an online video conferencing platform that was created in order to connect the youth to seniors.

         <h2> Importance of InterGen

        <p>
        According to UCSF, more than 40 percent of seniors regularly experience 
        loneliness. Researchers have found that the feeling of separation and 
        disconnection from others may predict serious health problems and even death. 
        
      An intergenerational relationship is advangtagous for both seniors and students. 
        Through these conversations, both groups will be able to find a new sense of purpose and learn new skills. 
        In addition, this video calling system may help alleviate fears that students have of the elderly. 
        Senior Citizens are more likely to be energized and this may also reduce the likelihood of depression.

       <h2> How does it work?
        
      </h2> 
        <p>
        
        This platform contains a Sign In Page for both students and seniors to log in. 
        Both students and seniors will be able to chat with eachother using the video call button, 
        and also see their previous call history. There is a timer as well so that students can track their volunteer progress
        and send it to counselors for approval.
